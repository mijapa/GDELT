abstract = {This paper summarizes the current state-of-the-art for generating$\$nhigh-volume, near-real-time event data using automated coding methods,$\$nbased on recent efforts for the DARPA Integrated Crisis Early Warning$\$nSystem (ICEWS) and NSF-funded research. The ICEWS work expanded by$\$nmore than two orders of magnitude previous automated coding efforts,$\$ncoding of about 26-million sentences generated from 8-million stories$\$ncondensed from around 30 gigabytes of text. The actual coding took$\$nsix minutes. The paper is largely a general "how-to" guide to the$\$npragmatic challenges and solutions to various elements of the process$\$nof generating event data using automated techniques. It also discusses$\$na number of ways that this could be augmented with existing open-source$\$nnatural language processing software to generate a third-generation$\$nevent data coding system.},
